# Nokogiri Sushi

Dinner Dash was a school project completed in less than 3 weeks with four members: Chandra, Kate, Alex, and myself. 

The assignment was to create an e-commerce website for a fictional restaurant that would allow users to purchase food and have it delivered to their residence.  Users can log in and add items to their cart, and from there a user can complete and place an order.  We had a lot of fun with this project, evidenced by our ridiculous prices and imaginative "About" section on the website.
